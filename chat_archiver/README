Chat archiver records messages from TMI (the twitch messaging system)
in a way that preserves as much context as possible, and allows multiple independently-recorded
streams to be combined to ensure nothing was missed.

We store messages in newline-delimited JSON files, in timestamp order.
Each file covers one minute of messages.
These files are named by their timestamp + hash and merged with other files via a CRDT model.
	CRDT means you have a merge operation (.) such that
		(A.B).C == A.(B.C) (associative)
		A.B == B.A (commutitive)
		A.A == A (reflexive)

We have a few different kinds of messages to deal with:
	Messages with a unique id and timestamp
		eg. PRIVMSG, USERNOTICE.
		These are easy, as they have a canonical timestamp and can be trivially deduplicated by id.
	Messages with an implied ordering
		eg. ROOMSTATE, NOTICE, CLEARCHAT.
		These messages arrive in what we assume is a consistent order on all clients,
		but have no direct associated timestamp. We thus set a timestamp *range* for when
		the message could have occurred from the server's perspective, between the last known
		server timestamp (since it must be after that message) and the next received server timestamp
		(since it must be before that message). We can set some reasonable timeout here in case
		we don't receive another message within a short time window.
		Messages with a timestamp range are ordered by their timestamp start.
		This also governs which file they are in if their range overlaps two files.
	Messages known to be out of order
		This is specific to JOINs and PARTs.
		Twitch documents that these may be delayed by up to 10sec.
		So we follow the rules as per messages with implied ordering,
		except we pad the possible start time by 10 seconds.

How to merge two files
	In general, if the same message (all non-receiver fields identical) is present in both files,
		it is included once in the output. For messages with unique ids, this is all that's needed.
	For messages without unique ids, we face the question of "is this the same message".
	All the following must be true:
		* All non-timestamp, non-receiver fields match
		* Timestamp ranges overlap
	If a message may match multiple messages on the other side with these rules, then
	we pick one arbitrarily.
	We then merge these messages, setting the timestamp range to the intersection of the inputs.
	Literal edge cases: Timestamp ranges that span two files
		It may be the case that we can match a message whose timestamp range overhangs file A
		with a message near the start of file B. So whenever we are merging files, we need to
		also consider the file before and the file after on our side.
	In all cases when we merge two messages, we should merge the receiver timestamp field which maps
		the receiver id to the timestamp it received the message. This preserves message provedence.

All files are stored in newline-delimited, canonicalised JSON so we can use hashes to compare them.
It should always be true that merging B into A and merging A into B should produce identical files
with the same hash (effects of neighboring files notwithstanding - that just means more merges will
be needed in order to stabilize).
