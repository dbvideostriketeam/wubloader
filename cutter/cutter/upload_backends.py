	They should also indicate if the error is retryable without
	manual intervention.
	Examples of retryable errors:
		Short-term rate limits (try again in a few seconds)
		Upload backends which are fully idempotent
	Examples of unretryable errors:
		Bad Request (indicates logic bug, or that the video is unacceptable in some way)
		Long-term rate limits (trying again quickly is counterproductive, wait for operator)
	Examples of errors which should not be caught, allowing the FINALIZING logic
	to determine if it's safe to retry:
		500s (We don't know if the request went through)
		Network errors (same as above)
		Unexpected exceptions (they might have occurred after the upload is finished)

	Raisers should log the underlying exception before raising, as this error
	will not be further logged.

	define the 'needs_transcode' attribute as True.
	If it does, it should also have a method check_status(ids) which takes a
	list of video ids and returns a list of the ones who have finished processing.

	The upload backend also determines the encoding settings for the cutting
	process, this is given as a list of ffmpeg args
	under the 'encoding_settings' attribute.
	If this is None, instead uses the 'fast cut' strategy where nothing
	is transcoded.

	In addition, if the output format doesn't need a seekable file,
