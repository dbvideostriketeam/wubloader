	"""Decorator that instruments wrapped function to record real, user and system time
	as a prometheus histogram.

	Metrics are recorded as NAME_latency, NAME_cputime{type=user} and NAME_cputime{type=system}
	respectively. User and system time are process-wide (which means they'll be largely meaningless
	if you're using gevent and the wrapped function blocks) and do not include subprocesses.

	NAME defaults to the wrapped function's name.

	Any labels passed in are included. Given label values may be callable, in which case
	they are passed the input and result from the wrapped function and should return a label value.
	Otherwise the given label value is used directly. All label values are automatically str()'d.

	In addition, the "error" label is automatically included, and set to "" if no exception
	occurs, or the name of the exception type if one does.

	The normalize argument, if given, causes the creation of a second set of metrics
	NAME_normalized_latency, etc. The normalize argument should be a callable which
	takes the input and result of the wrapped function and returns a normalization factor.
	All normalized metrics divide the observed times by this factor.
	The intent is to allow a function which is expected to take longer given a larger input
	to be timed on a per-input basis.
	As a special case, when normalize returns 0 or None, normalized metrics are not updated.

	The buckets kwarg is as per prometheus_client.Histogram. The default is a conservative
	but sparse range covering nanoseconds to hours.
	The normalized_buckets kwarg applies to the normalized metrics, and defaults to the same
	as buckets.

	All callables that take inputs and result take them as follows: The first arg is the result,
	followed by *args and **kwargs as per the function's inputs.
	If the wrapped function errored, result is None.
	To simplify error handling in these functions, any errors are taken to mean None,
	and None is interpreted as '' for label values.

	Contrived Example:
		@timed("scanner",
			# constant label
			foo="my example label",
			# label dependent on input
			all=lambda results, predicate, list, find_all=False: find_all,
			# label dependent on output
			found=lambda results, *a, **k: len(found) > 0,
			# normalized on input
			normalize=lambda results, predicate, list, **k: len(list),
		)
		def scanner(predicate, list, find_all=False):
			results = []
			for item in list:
				if predicate(item):
					results.append(item)
					if not find_all:
						break
			return results
