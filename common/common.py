	Similarly, unless the first item is None, the first segment starts <= the start of the time
	range, and unless the last item is None, the last segment ends >= the end of the time range.

		Suppose you ask for a time range from 10 to 60. We have 10-second segments covering
		the following times:
			5 to 15
